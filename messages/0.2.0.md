Constellation 0.2.0
-------------------

This release slightly changes the format of the .sublime-preferences file by removing the "open" key from each constellation, and moving it into a cache file. 

If you have an existing file, you should notice that it has been upgraded to the new format.

This change has two goals:

1. "open" constellations are now roughly distinct per install. This means users can sync their constellations, but have different constellations open on each system.
2. Users who track their constellations in git or other VCS systems will notice fewer changes/diffs caused merely by a local install opening and closing constellations.
